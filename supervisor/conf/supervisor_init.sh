# Author:       Mike McGrath <mmcgrath@redhat.com> (based off yumupdatesd)
#               Jason Koppe <jkoppe@indeed.com> adjusted to read sysconfig,
#                   use supervisord tools to start/stop, conditionally wait
#                   for child processes to shutdown, and startup later
#               Mikhail Mingalev <mingalevme@gmail.com> Merged
#                   redhat-init-jkoppe and redhat-sysconfig-jkoppe, and
#                   made the script "simple customizable".
